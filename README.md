this is my learning and study coding .
AND during those days I learn a bit , but I will practice more and learn to be a good programmer , rather than a coder.

Just do it , enjoy coding and have fun.

and I finally do the .gitignore file successfully. It is great and amazing!


I can make a test here to give you some change , so you can get it from here.
