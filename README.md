this is my learning and study coding .
AND during those days I learn a bit , but I will practice more and learn to be a good programmer , rather than a coder.

Just do it , enjoy coding and have fun.


1 use nuget to pacakge the project:
  nuget spec  (=>Package.nuspec  modify the file generated.)
  nuget pack Package.nuspec
  in VS,tools-> package manager , add it .
